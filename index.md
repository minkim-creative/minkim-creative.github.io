Greetings and salutations! My name is Min and I’m a copywriter who likes to tsk when your I’s are not dotted and your T’s are not crossed. Being detail-oriented is both a blessing and painful, especially when the impulse to cringe towards terrible content or ill use of the semi-colon kicks in. But it comes in awful handy when copywriting and copyediting skills comes in need. I’ve been a copywriter since 2015, working mostly in e-commerce industries and occasional dabbles in agencies. I love utilizing the English vernacular in order to channel creativity and working collaboratively with various teams in order to accomplish something amazing. Check out some of my work and feel free to ask me any questions at __min.jung.kim18@gmail.com__.

Kickstarting or rebranding your company is always challenging. But it’s an exciting opportunity for creatives to collaborate and develop wonderful content. A brand definitely needs a voice - a core visual that will let your audience understand who you are and what your brand represents. Great copywriting can shape the brand and give it life. I’ve had the privilege to work with great teams to help brainstorm and write content for various clients, anywhere from taglines to web copy.
